<h1>Crochet Pattern Generator</h1>

<p>This program takes an image as an input and is able to map that image to a grid so that someone can use it to follow as a pattern for corcheting. The Matlab-Legacy folder contains a working Matlab srcipt for the pattern generator, but it is not a stable version of the code.</p>

<h1>TO-DO:</h1>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Move program away from Matlab, either to web based or java.</li>
        <li>Make usage easier.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
